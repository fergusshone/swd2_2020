Some initial data analysis to identify how inflammation changes over time after surgery.

Jane is a data scientist and Samit is a statistician.

We'll need to determine !!!!!!XXXX who is responsible for what in our project.

We may need to bring a third person into this project with Python programmming skills.

The third team member is average.

We need to test his competency in R and C++.

Matplotlib and version control skills will also be useful.
